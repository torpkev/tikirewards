Tiki Rewards allows you to provide rewards to your players for helping out, donating, online time or just because

You can specify multiple reward ranks which provide various types of rewards, including:
- Being added to a specific group
- In-Game money (check your ToS before using)
- Items
- Spawners

Any in-game item can be given to the user and can be custom lore-tagged for tracking purposes.
Tagging adds the reward type, the player name and date of reward to the lore.  With this, you can see why a player may have a reward item (for example, an elytra).  Tagging is intended only for non-block items, though you can tag blocks, if placed and broken they will lose their tag.
Mob spawners will be created with their proper mob type, will be automatically tagged.  When placed, they will be tracked and an admin can locate them via a command.  If broken, the item will vanish and be available to claim again.

To prevent players not being able to receive their reward items if offline or if they have a full inventory, the items will not be automatically given, but instead held internally until the player claims them. 

Players can be set to automatically be placed in a group as part of their reward, and can be set to automatically be removed from other groups as needed - this prevents overlap of different levels of reward.  You can prevent the player being removed from any particular group by setting up the keep_groups list in the configuration.
